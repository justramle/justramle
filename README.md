## About Me
<div align="left"> 
  
- 🍀 I like pink 🌸 stuffs
- 🍀 My little love for boba 🧋 led to a fun twist: I created a quirky landing page for it in my free time and call it a little corner where my boba obsession gets to shine 🤫🤭 <strong><a href="https://justramle.github.io/boba/">Click to check it out!</a></strong> ✨🌟
- 🍀 I'm full-time CS student at KSU 👩🏻‍💻 📝 ✏️
- 🍀 My academic journey has helped me understanding the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithm design as well as testing methodologies.
- 🍀 My passion particularly lies in machine learning, especially deep neural networks. The topic of GraphNN and GraphML was introduced by my instructor initally captured my attention. Especially, I find the process of training models and recognize patterns to make decisions based on the interconnection layers particularly fascinating. Not only utilize frameworks and librarys to achieve the result, I also desire to learn and understand it from the ground up. The unique and intriguing challenge of machine learning motivate me to delve deeper and applying these skills in real-world scenarios such as climate change,... Although I am not perfect at it yet but I am constantly learning and improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.
